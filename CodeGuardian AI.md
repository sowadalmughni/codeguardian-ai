CodeGuardian AI provides automated security reviews for your Python code directly in GitHub Pull Requests. Get Snyk-level security analysis at ChatGPT speed.

## üîç Overview

CodeGuardian AI is a GitHub-integrated service that automatically analyzes your Python code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and best practice violations. It provides actionable feedback directly in your Pull Requests, helping you ship more secure code faster.

### Key Features

- **Automated Security Reviews**: Detect OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, including injection flaws, broken authentication, and sensitive data exposure
- **GitHub-Native Integration**: Works directly within your existing GitHub workflow
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages advanced LLMs to provide context-aware security recommendations
- **Zero Configuration**: Install the GitHub App and get immediate value with no setup required
- **Actionable Feedback**: Receive specific, line-by-line suggestions to fix identified issues

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the [CodeGuardian AI GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codeguardian-ai)
2. Select the repositories you want to analyze
3. Create or update a Pull Request containing Python code
4. Receive automated security feedback within minutes

### Example

```python
# Vulnerable code in PR
def process_user_input(user_input):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_input}'"
    execute_query(query)
```

CodeGuardian AI will identify this SQL injection vulnerability and suggest:

```python
# Recommended secure approach
def process_user_input(user_input):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
    execute_query(query, (user_input,))
```
